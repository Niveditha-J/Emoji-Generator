# Emotion Detection from Image

## Overview

This project uses a **pre-trained emotion detection model** to predict the emotion of a person from an image. The emotion categories include:

- Angry
- Disgust
- Fear
- Happy
- Sad
- Surprise
- Neutral

The model is based on the **FER-2013 dataset** and can classify emotions based on facial expressions. The goal of this project is to build a simple yet effective emotion detection system that can analyze a given image and predict the emotion in real-time.

## Requirements

To run the code successfully, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- `opencv-python`: OpenCV library for image and video processing.
- `keras`: Keras library to work with deep learning models.
- `matplotlib`: To display images and results.
- `numpy`: To handle numerical operations.
  
You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python opencv-python-headless keras matplotlib numpy
